<h1>Introduction and Executive Summary</h1>

The <a href="http://www.amsat.org/amsat/sats/n7hpr/ao40.html">
AMSAT-OSCAR 40 spacecraft</a>, launched 16 November 2000 by an Ariane
5 into geostationary transfer orbit, uses a digital telemetry format
virtually unchanged from that carried on the Phase 3A spacecraft
launched in 1980.

The <a href="http://www.amsat.org/amsat/sats/ao40/ao40-tlm.html">AO-40
telemetry format</a> consists of fixed-size blocks of user data
transmitted at 400 bps with Manchester encoding and binary
phase-shift-keying on a suppressed RF carrier. Each block consists of
a 32-bit sync vector, 512 bytes of user data and a 2-byte CRC. There
is no other error control coding.

<p>

This format works well when link conditions are good, but poorly under
suboptimal conditions. A particular problem appears when the
spacecraft antennas are off-pointed from the earth, as they must be at
certain times to ensure sufficient solar panel illumination and/or to
control spacecraft temperature. Under these conditions, the
spacecraft's antenna patterns and its spin
give rise to periodic fades that can be very deep.
Overall signal levels are also reduced.

</p><p>

The intent of the present project is to devise a new format for AO-40
telemetry that uses strong error control coding and interleaving to
resist the effects of spin fading. A secondary goal is to reduce
average signal-to-noise ratio requirements to permit the use of poorer
(i.e., lower G/T) ground stations.

</p><h2>Performance</h2>

<p>The format described here has been implemented in software and
tested on a simulated channel. The channel simulator applies a
sinusoidal envelope to simulate spin fading (with two nulls
per cycle) and adds Gaussian noise to simulate receiver and cosmic
background noise. The improvement over the old uncoded format is,
quite simply, dramatic: solid copy is easily attained with fade rates
comparable to those observed in practice, and with average Eb/No
ratios down to about 7 dB. Because of the rate 0.4 (-4dB) coding, such
signals "sound" like uncoded BPSK at an average Eb/No of only 3 dB.
This is barely detectable to the human ear even at the peaks between
nulls.  In these conditions, approximately 15% (or about 780 out of
5200) of the raw demodulated channel symbols are in error, but are
completely corrected by the error control coding. In the present uncoded
format, just one channel error will ruin an entire frame.

</p><h2>Implementation</h2>

<h3>Encoder</h3>

The prototype encoder is a UNIX/Linux "filter", written in C, that
reads user data on standard input and emits 16-bit audio samples on
standard output representing the encoded and modulated data.

<p>A separate <a href="http://www.ka9q.net/papers/encode_ref.c">reference implementation</a> of
the encoder has been written in C.  It is intended to be translated
into IPS for integration into the operational software running in the
IHU.

</p><p>GCC on the Pentium compiles the reference encoder into about 900
bytes of program space plus about 1300 bytes for variables, lookup
tables and the output buffer. Several space-time tradeoffs are
possible; e.g., if additional RAM is available, it can be used for
extra lookup tables to reduce CPU loading. Prime candidates for
additional lookup tables are byte parity computation (256 bytes) and
scrambler sequence generation (320 bytes).

</p><h3>Demodulator/Decoder</h3>
<p>The prototype demodulator/decoder is a UNIX/Linux filter that accepts
16-bit samples from a generic sound card and emits decoded, corrected
data to standard output, with optional informational messages to
standard error. The software is primarily in GNU C and can port to any
environment supported by that compiler; it is intended to be integrated
into popular telemetry reception programs such as AO40RCV.

</p><p>Optional assembler code is provided that
uses the various Intel/AMD IA32 SIMD instruction sets, if available, to
reduce CPU utilization
in filtering and Viterbi decoding. All three generations of
IA32 SIMD instructions are supported: MMX, SSE and SSE2. Demodulating
and decoding in real time uses less than 1% of a 500 MHz Pentium III
CPU with SSE.

</p><p>The demodulator currently uses a purely noncoherent DBPSK technique
well suited for fading channels with Doppler shift and other carrier
phase disturbances. A future
enhancement is to add a coherent demodulator that is expected to
reduce Eb/No requirements by another 4 dB or so (i.e., to about 3dB)
on non fading channels, and to automatically select whichever technique
works best for the current conditions.

</p><h1>The New Format, in Detail</h1>

<h2>Basic Assumptions</h2>

The AO-40 spacecraft is already in orbit, so no changes can be made to
the existing on-board hardware. Software changes are possible, subject
to resource constraints (memory, processing time) in the on-board
computer.

<p>The AO-40 telemetry hardware follows its heritage to the original
Phase 3 project begun in the mid 1970s and first flown on the
ill-fated Phase 3A in May 1980. Software running in the IHU
formats a telemetry frame in IHU memory, and hardware then takes over: the
data is converted to a bit serial format, differentially encoded,
Manchester encoded, low-pass filtered to limit bandwidth, and used to
phase-shift-key an IF carrier with a balanced modulator. This
modulated signal is then injected into the transponder where it is
up-converted to RF, amplified and transmitted along with repeated
uplink signals in the spacecraft downlink.
Any new AO-40 telemetry format must therefore use the existing
differential encoder, Manchester encoder, filter and 400 bps BPSK
modulator without change. 

</p><p>However, many elements of the existing telemetry format are
implemented in software and can be changed or removed. These include
the sync vector, the CRC and the exact length of a frame.

</p><h2>Overview of the Proposal</h2>

The new coded format borrows extensively from current practice in
non-amateur deep space research satellites, particularly from
standards promulgated by the Consultative Committee for Space Data
Systems (<a href="http://www.ccsds.org/">CCSDS</a>).
Of particular importance is
<a href="http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-5.pdf">
CCSDS 101.0-B-5: Telemetry Channel Coding. Blue Book. Issue 5. June 2001</a>,
which should be read along with this document.

The following sections describe each aspect of the proposed format,
accompanied by a rationale.

<h3>Block Size</h3>

Each encoded frame in the proposed format contains 256 bytes
of arbitrary (binary or ASCII) user information and takes exactly 13 seconds to
transmit at 400 symbols/sec.

<p><em>Rationale:</em> Cutting the user payload in half from the
previous uncoded format creates room for coding overhead while keeping
approximately the same frame duration as the old format: 13 s for the
new vs 10.36 s for the present. When the 2.6 s of idle inter-frame
padding in the old format (but not the new) is considered, the two
frame formats are nearly the same length.

</p><p>The most common telemetry frame (A-frame) in current use consists
of two halves: 256 bytes of relatively static ASCII text followed by
256 bytes of binary-encoded telemetry data. A 256-byte frame size
still allows these two blocks of information to be sent separately,
possibly at different intervals.

</p><h3>Reed-Solomon Encoding</h3>

Each block of 256 data bytes is byte interleaved into two systematic
(160,128) Reed-Solomon codewords over GF(256), i.e., with 8-bit
symbols. The even-numbered bytes of the user data form the 128 data
bytes of the first Reed-Solomon codeword, and the odd-numbered data
bytes form the second Reed-Solomon codeword.

<p>The (160,128) Reed-Solomon code is shortened from the standard
(255,223) Reed-Solomon code specified by the CCSDS. (See CCSDS 101.0-B-5,
section 3). The shortening is
accomplished by zero-padding the first 95 symbols of the data field of
each Reed-Solomon codeword.

</p><p>The field generator for GF(256) as specified by CCSDS is the polynomial

</p><pre>F(x) = x^8 + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1
</pre>

<p>The Reed-Solomon code generator polynomial as specified by CCSDS is

</p><pre>g(x) = Product(j=112,j&lt;=143,(x-&#945;^11j))
</pre>

i.e., the repeated product of the 32 terms (x-&#945;^11j) for values of j
from 112 to 143 inclusive. The factor &#945;^11 is the primitive root
specified by CCSDS.

<p>This is another way of saying that the roots of the code generator
polynomial are &#945;^11j for values of j from 112 to 143 inclusive.

</p><p>Multiplied out, the 33 coefficients of the generator polynomial g(x)
are expressed as the following powers of &#945;:
</p><pre>G0  = G32 = 0
G1  = G31 = 249
G2  = G30 = 59
G3  = G29 = 66
G4  = G28 = 4
G5  = G27 = 43
G6  = G26 = 126
G7  = G25 = 251
G8  = G24 = 97
G9  = G23 = 30
G10 = G22 = 3
G11 = G21 = 213
G12 = G20 = 50
G13 = G19 = 66
G14 = G18 = 170
G15 = G17 = 5
G16 =       24
</pre>

where g(x) = G0 + G1*x + G2*(x^2) + G3*(x^3) + ... + G32*(x^32)

<p>Note that while the CCSDS standard Reed-Solomon code specifies the
use of Berlekamp's "dual basis" for each symbol, here the <em>conventional</em>
polynomial basis is used.

</p><p><em>Rationale</em>: Large Reed-Solomon block codes are easy to
generate and provide excellent burst-error detection and correcting
ability. This particular code can correct up to 16 byte errors in each
codeword. Reed-Solomon codes are widely used in conjunction with
Viterbi-decoded convolutional codes (discussed below) to "clean up"
the errors made by the Viterbi decoder. Because of the nonlinear
nature of Viterbi decoding, these errors occur in bursts even when the
channel errors are random, as with Gaussian noise.  In this
application the burst error correction capability provides a second
defense against channel fading, although this is the primary
responsibility of the block interleaver discussed below.

</p><p>Interleaving the user data in even/odd fashion into the two RS
codewords allows the parity bytes in the two RS codewords to be
computed "on the fly" as each data byte is presented, avoiding the
need to buffer the entire user data frame in the encoder.

</p><p>Shortening the code allows the data portion of the codeword to be
set to 128, one half the desired user payload of 256 bytes. Two
codewords are thus necessary. To handle 256 bytes of user data in a
single Reed-Solomon codeword, a code over GF(512) could have been
chosen, but this would imply 9-bit symbols that would be clumsy to
handle on byte-oriented CPUs.

</p><p>Shortening the code by padding with zeros at the start makes it
easy to implement an encoder that simply "skips over" the padded data,
spending CPU cycles only on actual user data.  The syndrome
computation in the decoder can be similarly optimized.

</p><p>CCSDS chose this particular field generator and code generator
polynomial and specified the dual basis representation to minimize the
gate complexity of the Galois field multipliers in a custom hardware encoder.

</p><p>Because the coefficients of the generator polynomial are
palindromic, there are only half as many distinct coefficients
as there are terms in the polynomial. This halves the number of distinct
Galois multiplications that must be performed. Furthermore, two pairs
are the same (G3 = G29 = G13 = G19 = 4), and another pair (G0 and G32)
are 0, implying multiplication by unity.

</p><p>The choice of field generator has no effect on the complexity of a
software implementation that uses log/anti-log lookup tables and
ordinary addition to perform Galois field multiplication, while the
palindromic code generator polynomial does potentially halve the
required number of distinct Galois field multiplications per data
byte. So there is no particular reason not to use this aspect of the
CCSDS standard RS code.

</p><p>However, the "dual basis" representation actually complicates a
software RS codec. And since we are implementing this code in
software the dual-basis representation is not used.

</p><h3>Scrambling</h3>

After Reed-Solomon coding, the user data is pseudo-randomized
(scrambled) by XORing with the pseudo-random (PN) sequence generated
by the CCSDS-specified polynomial

<pre>h(x) = x^8 + x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + 1
</pre>

This PN sequence starts with 8 1's, i.e., the shift register is initialized
to all 1's, and repeats after 255 bits. The first bit of the sequence
is XORed with the high order bit of the first data byte, the 8th bit
of the PN sequence covers the high order bit of the second data byte
(the first in the second Reed-Solomon codeword), and so on.  The PN
sequence covers the Reed-Solomon parity bytes as well as the user
data. (See CCSDS 101.0-B-5 section 6.5.)

<p><em>Rationale:</em> Experimentation showed that DBPSK demodulator
performance was significantly worse on an all-0's data frame due to
impaired symbol time tracking caused by insufficient transition
density in the encoded and interleaved data stream, aggravated by the
inherent ambiguities of Manchester encoding in this situation. I first
tried to overcome this by inverting the output of every other symbol
from the convolutional encoder as called for by the CCSDS spec, taking
care that these became channel reversals after block
interleaving, but this still proved insufficient. Covering the
Reed-Solomon codewords with a PN sequence introduces a sufficient
transition density to overcome this problem.

</p><p>In the event that the user data exactly matches the PN sequence
bits covering the data, the scrambled Reed-Solomon parity symbols
would still be non-zero. Even though such a frame is clearly unlikely,
it would still contain a greater number of channel symbol transitions
than would an unscrambled frame consisting of all zeros.

</p><h3>Byte Interleaving and Convolutional Coding</h3>

The scrambled Reed-Solomon codewords are next byte-interleaved and
encoded using the CCSDS standard constraint length 7, rate 1/2 (k=7,
r=1/2) convolutional code. The encoder shift register starts in the
all 0's state. The two connection vectors for this code G1 and G2 are,
in octal, 171 and 133 for an encoder shift register fed from the high
end.

<p>The output of the G2 taps is inverted, as specified by the CCSDS.
See CCSDS 101.0-B-5 section 2 for encoder block diagrams and
connection vectors.

</p><p>Each 8-bit Reed-Solomon symbol is sent into the convolutional
encoder in "big endian" order, i.e., most significant bit first.  The
first 8 bits into the convolutional encoder come from the first data
byte of the "even" Reed-Solomon codeword. The next 8 bits come from
the first byte of the "odd" Reed-Solomon codeword, the third 8 bits
come from the second data byte of the "even" RS codeword, and so
on. After all the data bytes have been sent, the RS parity bytes are
sent in identical fashion. When all parity bytes have been encoded,
six zero bits are encoded (without scrambling)
to form a "tail" for the convolutional encoder,
returning the encoder shift register to the all-0's state.

</p><p><em>Rationale:</em> The use of byte interleaving between
concatenated Reed-Solomon and convolutional codes is a well
established technique.  This helps distribute individual error bursts
from the Viterbi decoder across the two Reed-Solomon codewords to
reduce the chances of either having an uncorrectable number of byte
errors (more than 16).  The choice of interleaving pattern, along with
the ordering of the user data into the Reed-Solomon codewords, allows
the concatenated RS encoder/byte interleaver/convolutional encoder to
process user data one byte at a time, without having to explicitly
store the user data.  Aside from a few variables, the only internal
encoder state required are the two 32-byte Reed-Solomon shift
registers and the 5200-bit (650 byte) output interleaver.

</p><p>The choice of bit order is arbitrary, so there was no particular
reason to depart from CCSDS practice.

</p><p>This particular convolutional code has a long and distinguished
history; it exists in many hardware and software implementations.  My
own Viterbi decoders for the Intel MMX/SSE/SSE2 instruction sets
achieve speeds well in excess of what is required here (about 9
megabits/sec on a 1 GHz Pentium-III with SSE).

</p><p>There have been several conventions for the ordering and polarity
of the two encoded symbols. We follow the CCSDS standard, including
the inversion of the second symbol to help guarantee a minimum channel
bit transition density.  This isn't really necessary since we also
have a scrambler, but nor does it hurt.

</p><p>Encoding this code is extremely simple, and it works well on deep
space channels with reasonable Viterbi decoder complexity (which is
exponential with constraint length). However, advances in technology
now make longer constraint codes entirely practical, and such codes do
provide greater coding gain on the non-fading Gaussian noise
channel. However, my references claim that these increased gains are
not generally realized on fading channels.  There is room in the
encoded frame to go to a r=1/2 k=9 code, which I have already
implemented, and it should be tried experimentally at some point.

</p><h3>Block Interleaving and Sync</h3>

The convolutionally encoded data is next written by rows into a block
interleaver with dimensions of 80 rows by 65 columns, starting with
the second row.  Each interleaver element is one bit, for a total
interleaver size of 5200 bits or 650 bytes. The first row of the
interleaver is reserved for a fixed 65-bit synchronization vector
generated by the first 65 bits of the PN sequence produced by the
polynomial

<pre>s(x) = x^7 + x^3 + 1
</pre>

The 7-bit shift register is set to all 1's at the start of the frame;
the entire sequence is:

<pre>11111110000111011110010110010010000001000100110001011101011011000
</pre>

<p>The sync bits are the same in each frame and need be written into
the interleaver only once if they are not disturbed.

</p><p>When filled, the block interleaver contains 65 sync vector bits and
5132 symbols from the convolutional encoder. These 5132 symbols in
turn come from the 2048 bits (256 bytes) of user data, the 512 bits of
Reed-Solomon parity, and the 6 tail bits, or 2566 in all,
times two for the rate 1/2 convolutional code:

</p><pre>(2048 + 512 + 6) * 2 = 5132 encoder output symbols
</pre>

The 5132 symbols from the convolutional encoder plus the 65 sync bits
make 5197 bits in all, leaving the last 3 bits unused in the block
interleaver. This space is available for the additional tail bits
of a longer constraint length convolutional code, if desired.

<p>Once the block interleaver has been filled with sync and encoded
data, it is read out by columns and sent to the differential encoder,
Manchester encoder, filter and BPSK modulator. The first symbol transmitted
is therefore the first bit of the sync vector. This is followed by the first
symbol from the convolutional encoder, then the 66th and 131st, and so
on until all 80 rows of the first column have been sent. Then the second
bit of the sync vector is transmitted followed by the 2nd, 67th and 132nd
symbols from the convolutional encoder, and so on.

</p><p><em>Rationale:</em> Here we add something to CCSDS
practice; this block interleaver and sync vector is wholly new for the
Phase 3 format. This is because the CCSDS standards are designed for
non-fading Gaussian noise channels, while our primary concern is
spin fading. Because this fading can be quite slow, we want to
interleave over the longest possible time span, i.e., one frame
time. A block interleaver is the classic way to do this when the data
is packetized, as it is here.

</p><p>This leaves the choice of exact interleaver size and
dimensions. The number 5200 is large enough to accommodate all the
encoded bits plus the sync vector with only 3 bits left over,
<em>and</em> it factors into a roughly square (65 x 80) array.

</p><p>The length of the sync vector was chosen to provide reasonable
energy for reliable detection in the presence of noise and fading
without consuming too much overhead. Since the FEC is strong enough to
operate at an Eb/No of 3 dB (on a non-fading channel, with coherent
detection), we want the sync vector to have enough energy to permit
reliable detection under these conditions. The overall code rate is
(256/320) * (1/2) = 0.4, so the Es/No is 10log10(0.4) = -4 dB relative
to the Eb/No. So an Eb/No of 3 dB is an Es/No of -1 dB.

</p><p>A correlator looking for a 65-bit sync vector will have an output
signal-to-noise ratio 10log10(65) = 16 dB above the input SNR
(Es/No). So for Es/No = -1dB, the correlator output
SNR will be +15 dB.  And 15 dB is the usual rule of thumb
for reasonably reliable detection.

</p><p>Interleaving the sync vector into the encoded data is an essential
anti-fading measure. If only the encoded data were interleaved, the
sync vector would remain as an Achilles heel; a fade that removed the
sync vector would kill the entire frame, as it does now in the present
uncoded format.

</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>

This format, if adopted and implemented, should dramatically improve
the performance of AO-40 telemetry links, particularly under
conditions of poor squint angle and/or poor ground station
performance. The format is practical to implement in IHU software and
in ground station computers -- even those with limited resources by
modern PC standards.


<h2>Other comments</h2>

<h3>Choice of code rate</h3>

The code rate of 0.4 was chosen to provide reasonable coding gain
without excessive overhead. It is also reasonably close to the optimum
code rate for noncoherent binary modulation (DBPSK).

<p>While lower code rates provide asymptotically greater coding gain
with coherent modulation, this is not the case for noncoherent
modulation because of a "threshold" effect much like the one in FM
(which is also noncoherent).  Below the threshold, demodulator output
SNR falls much more quickly than the input SNR, and this overpowers
the additional coding gain. There is a minimum Es/No below which the
system simply won't work very well, regardless of coding,
placing a lower practical bound on the code rate and implying the
existence of an "optimum" code rate. The optimum rate is different for
fading and nonfading channels; it is around 0.5 (1/2) for a nonfading
channel and about 0.2 for a Rayleigh fading channel (our "spin
faded" channel is probably somewhere in between.)  Fortunately the
optimum is fairly broad, so rate 0.4 works reasonably well in both
cases.

</p><p>Another lower bound on code rate comes from the increased
difficulty of carrier and symbol time tracking at the lower Es/No
ratios implied by these codes. The trend in signal design for
terrestrial fading channels (e.g., terrestrial digital cellular) is to
use spread spectrum to provide time tracking and other benefits and to
add coherent carrier references ("pilots") to assist in carrier phase
tracking without the "squaring losses" associated with carrier
recovery from suppressed carrier signals, e.g., with Costas or
squaring loops. However, this would require hardware that is
unavailable on the AO-40 IHU.


</p><h3>Why not turbo codes?</h3>

<p>Some readers may ask: why not turbo codes? Why use
FEC technology that has already been around for 25 years?

</p><p>The answer is simple: while turbo codes do outperform by 1-2 dB the
classic concatenated codes proposed here, they were only discovered in
the early 1990s and as such are surrounded by a minefield of patents
that will not begin to expire for another decade. The Viterbi decoder
was invented in the late 1960s, and the concatenated code used here
has been around, almost in the present form, since before Voyager 1
and 2 were launched in 1977, so all patents on this technology have
long since expired.  Block interleaving and noncoherent DBPSK
demodulation are likewise established techniques that have been around
for decades.

</p><p>Technology unencumbered by intellectual property rights seems a
better match for an organization like AMSAT with limited financial
resources that depends on volunteer labor and emphasizes the open and
unrestricted dissemination of its technology to further its educational
and recreational goals.
