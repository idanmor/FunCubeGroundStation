This is a simple band pass filter application working on S16LE encoded complex
samples. It can be used in between a Funcube Dongle and the console version of
the Funcube telemetry decoder to increase the decoder efficiency.

This is just a quick hack temporary solution until we improve the decoder. Try
"filter -h" for options.
