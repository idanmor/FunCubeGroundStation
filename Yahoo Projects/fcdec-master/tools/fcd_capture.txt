I found sox to be the best and most reliable application to capture samples
from the FCD. See "man sox" for documentation.

For example:

 sox -q -r 96k -e signed-integer -b 16 --endian little -c 2 -t alsa hw:2 somefile.raw trim 0 800

Will capture raw 2 channel S16LE audio for 800 seconds from the second sound card.
Remove the -q to get status info during recording.

On systems with pulseaudio you might not able to use hw:x or pughw:x reliably.
In this case I have had success with using the pulseaudio backend in sox.
First, find the input device name:

 pactl list | grep -A2 'Source #' | grep 'Name: ' | cut -d" " -f2

and the sox command for capturing becomes somthing like:

 sox -q -r 96k -e signed-integer -b 16 --endian little -c 2 -t pulseaudio alsa_input.usb-Hanlincrest_Ltd._FUNcube_Dongle_V1.0-00-V10.analog-stereo file.raw


As an alternative one could try parec:

  parec --device=alsa_input.usb-Hanlincrest_Ltd._FUNcube_Dongle_V1.0-00-V10.analog-stereo --format=s16le --rate=44100 --channels=2 ...
